# CAN-Simulator
This is my (Adrien Jones) solution to the operating/distributed systems homework 2.

## Requirements:

1.     You must implement a model CAN as described in the text. That means is that your CONTENT addressable network must at least return the address of the CONTENT! This means that you will need to have content and associated addresses (keys) on a d-dimensional cartesian space. In practice, you might actually distribute the data but for our model, lets focus on the administrative side of this whereby the distributed system is "organized".
2.     Your model must support the addition and deletion of nodes. 
3.     You model should start with a single Node.
4.     You should allow the user to interact with the working model to select the function to be accomplished (deletion or addition).
5.     Your program must provide some visual display of THE CAN (... I just love that name....). ASCII art is acceptable; java visualization are acceptable; etc.. 
6.     Specific to the addition function... the function of addition must select a random point in THE CAN to add the new node.
7.     Your program should be intuitive. (i.e. I should not have to read the manual or the code to know how to use it!)
8.     Please let the grader know whether your software fully works or not. In addition, please self report problems running your code.
9.     The result of a lookup (this does not have to be visual; it can be text!)
10.     Lastly, you must provide evidence that your code works (i.e. provide a video walkthrough). I strongly suggest that you treat this like a 10-minute (or less) lesson on THE CAN. This is a last ditch effort on my part to validate that your code works and give you some points. But it is your code / result that is to be graded!
